Visual Studio Code has been my text editor of choice for awhile. I enjoy that it&#8217;s a bit out of left field when it comes to the VIM vs Emacs debates. One feature that I&#8217;ve missed when compared to sublime is the ability to easily do find and replace on text segments that span multiple lines:  <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15727>

To finally contribute something back to one of these projects, I made a quick and dirty extension that partly added this functionality:
