# Nest Thermostat

Apparently, there used to be a way to get Nest developer accounts that a lot of earlier projects were based on. Google closed this down which invalidated a lot of the existing guides.

A bit of Googling brought up three options.

1. Use the Google Device Access interface https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started
2. Google assistant nest integration / IFTTT - this actually didn't seem to work for my setup. Somewhat unclear what the issue is, my Google Home app showed the devices, but the assistant didn't seem to be able to link to them.
3. There was a effort for integrating the nest into an open source home automation stack: https://erwindekreuk.com/2020/04/control-my-nest-thermostat-on-my-domoticz-server-running-on-a-synology-diskstation/
4. takeout.google.com

Digging into option 3 eventually led to https://github.com/gboudreau/nest-api, but unsurprisingly it looks like a recent update probably broke this hacked API.

Next I tried option 1. I was under the impression this would be a fairly straight forward process, but that was very wrong.
