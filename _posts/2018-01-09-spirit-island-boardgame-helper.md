Over the holidays my wife and I had some fun playing Spirit Island. The game describes itself as &#8220;The cooperative settler-destruction strategy game&#8221;. As a fun project to refresh my Unity knowledge, I built a simple app for keeping track of some of the state. It&#8217;s pretty ugly since I just took some low quality photos of the board to use as the UI.[<img class="alignleft wp-image-594 size-full" src="http://robopenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Example.png" alt="" width="603" height="356" srcset="http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Example.png 603w, http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Example-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" />](http://robopenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Example.png)

The development went much better then my previous Unity attempts. Looks like they&#8217;ve streamlined UI development since I last tried.
