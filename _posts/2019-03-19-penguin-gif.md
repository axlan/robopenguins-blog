I've done a little GIF creation and pixel editting in the past, but I wanted to take another stab at making a sprite. I eventually found the awesome free program <https://graphicsgale.com/us/>.

I made a front and side view:

[<img class="aligncenter size-large" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2019/rail1_big.gif" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />]({{ site.image_host }}/2019/rail1_big.gif)

[<img class="aligncenter size-large" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2019/rail1_side_big.gif" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />]({{ site.image_host }}/2019/rail1_side_big.gif)

I decided to stick it in a neat scene from <http://www.dorkly.com/post/74717/this-artist-is-a-master-of-the-relaxing-pixel-gif>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(57.60% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/RemoteVainGazelle' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='background-color:#000000;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be a super easy way to automate the small movements through the 128 frames. I ended up setting up hotkeys and writing an [Autoit](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) macro to do some of the more tedious bits.
