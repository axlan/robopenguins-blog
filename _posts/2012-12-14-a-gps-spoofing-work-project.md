One of my work projects from awhile back popped up on Ars Technica.<figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

I didn&#8217;t do too much of the actual meat of the software. My job was mostly to program the inter-board communication, set up the kernel and software on the main processor, and do some of the hardware development to connect everything together.

This work previously had a minor mention in Slashdot <http://it.slashdot.org/story/12/12/10/0012217/researchers-find-crippling-flaws-in-global-gps>
