My first published android app. I decided to take a problem that I couldn&#8217;t find an existent app for and make a solution myself.

Plant Pal is a fairly minimal tool for keeping track of periodic events that are not reoccur after a set number of days instead of on certain days of the week. I decided to specifically focus on plant watering since I thought it would be more difficult to market the app as a periodic alarm system.

The functionality of the app is extremely simple, it was the extra features that ended up taking me awhile to code. Specifically getting an app to start at boot time and set up a alarm took awhile to figure out. A lot of the time spent was figuring out how to use all of the various intents to get the notifications to work properly. Another good chunk was setting up the SQL database to keep track of the plant status.
