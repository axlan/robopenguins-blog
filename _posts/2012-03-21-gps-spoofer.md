This was an app that I didn&#8217;t publish. It used the developer interface to control the phones apparent GPS location over the network. This was just a proof of concept, but it could be used to provide a GPS location from an alternative source for a better location fix, or do play with making the phone think it&#8217;s someplace it isn&#8217;t.
