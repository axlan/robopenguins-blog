A project at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, in Germany, to use accelerometers to track heart motion to aid in robotic surgery.

The final design involved having MEMS 3 axis accelerometers on tiny custom PCBs connect to an arduino through a I2C multiplexer. The Arduino would transmit the data to a PC which would process it.
