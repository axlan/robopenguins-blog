For a non-software related project my wife and I recently had a chance to paint some miniatures for our DnD characters.

Decided to try to do it right, and got a few smaller brushes, some acrylic paint, and a wash (a watery paint used to shadow folds and crevices). Mostly followed the advice from this video [MINIATURE BASICS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSp54e6_FFc). To finish the figures we used wood shellac since we had it lying around from another project.

First we painted a couple metal miniatures we got a long time ago, but never had a chance to paint.

I painted an half-orc librarian:

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-373 size-medium" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141228.jpg" alt="Solution 5">]({{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141228.jpg")

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-373 size-medium" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141258.jpg" alt="Solution 5">]({{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141258.jpg")

I was pretty happy with how this turned out, but in retrospect, I probably should have done the shawl and rope around the waste in their own colors.

Maria painted a cleric:

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-373 size-medium" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141237.jpg" alt="Solution 5">]({{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141237.jpg")

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-373 size-medium" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141306.jpg" alt="Solution 5">]({{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141306.jpg")

After that I painted a plastic figure I had 3D printed from [Hero Forge](https://www.heroforge.com/):

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-373 size-medium" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141245.jpg" alt="Solution 5">]({{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141245.jpg")

[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-373 size-medium" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141251.jpg" alt="Solution 5">]({{ site.image_host }}/2020/miniatures/IMG_20200205_141251.jpg")

I think I went a little too thick with the paint, the wash, and the shellac. It still looks OK, but I think the paint ended up obscuring some of the details.
