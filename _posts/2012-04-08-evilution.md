Selecting a type (plant or animal) you can place creatures on the board by clicking on the white area.  
They will try to survive and reproduce with their genes represented by their color. Time can be sped or slowed by changing the time speed value.  
There is a genome that encodes some of their traits that can be editted, but right now it is very primitive.

This takes the form a a java applet that used to be included here, but those are pretty much unviewable these days.
