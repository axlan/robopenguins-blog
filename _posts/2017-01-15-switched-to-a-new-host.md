After having a flaky VPS host for a year or so decided to switch to a new slightly less flaky host. I tried to remove some of the weird custom cruft this site has built up to make this easier in the future, but it&#8217;s still suffered some inevitable bit rot and some of the formatting got perturbed. I didn&#8217;t bother reposting the Java applets this time, though I might actually post the source at some point.
