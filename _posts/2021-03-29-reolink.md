Who watches the watchmen? In this case I set up a check to monitor my security cameras.

The main use case for the cameras:

This was a follow up to [Creating Home IT Monitoring with checkmk]({% post_url 2021-03-23-checkmk %}) and builds off of [Roomba Python API with checkmk]({% post_url 2021-03-26-roomba %}).

# Monitoring a Reolink

I originally decided to go with Reolink since they seemed less "Cloudy" then other network camera manufacturers. They have a lot of the cloud niceties, but don't make you go through their services unless you want to.

As a result it wasn't too surprising that there was already a nice Python library for doing everything I wanted and more: <https://github.com/ReolinkCameraAPI/reolinkapipy>

The initial metrics I implemented was one that checked that the on board storage was showing up, and another that counted how many motion events triggered in the last hour.

# Creating a Custom checkmk Check

I used the same basic framework for creating a local check as described in [Roomba Python API with checkmk]({% post_url 2021-03-26-roomba %}), but I extended it to be easier to work with as I add more scripts.

I created the repo <https://github.com/axlan/local_checks> for this development.

The idea is that rather then run the python code directly, a deploy script will copy the code along with wrapper scripts into place to setup the local checks I want to run. For instance for my two cameras:
1. I wrote the single python script [reolink_check](https://github.com/axlan/local_checks/blob/master/reolink_check). This script checks environment variables to get the settings it needs.
2. I created two instance scripts that look like:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SETTING_NAME='CAMERA_NAME' \
SETTING_HOST='CAMERA_IP' \
SETTING_USER='USERNAME' \
SETTING_PASS='PASSWORD' \
/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/scripts/reolink_check
```
  with the appropriate values.
3. I then run the `deploy.sh` script to copy these files into `/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/` where they'll be detected by checkmk

I could make a more sophisticated settings/deploy script, but these was a pretty simple way to be able to reuse and configure the scripts I was developing.

I also moved the code that handled generating the local check output strings to a shared utility function.
