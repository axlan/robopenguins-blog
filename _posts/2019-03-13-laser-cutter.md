Maria got me a k40 laser cutter for my birthday!

It was surprisingly easy to set up considering it probably had a pretty rough trip from China. I just followed the guide [here](https://k40laser.se/lens-mirrors/mirror-alignment-the-ultimate-guide/) to align the mirrors and I was ready to go.

To control the laser, I used InkScape to make the designs and [k40 whisperer](https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40w_manual.html) to connect to the laser.

Here's some pictures of the results:

This dice tower was based on [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2925474) designs
