Today I decided to break out a Alesis Q45 midi keyboard that I've had lying around. Much to my dismay, my computer had trouble detecting it. Looking at the device manager I was getting "Device Descriptor Request Failed" when I tried to plug it in.

Googling around, wasn't getting many results until I found this video.

While the issue in the video was with one of the power pins, I had the exact same issue with one of my data pins.

Did a quick blue wire fix, and it worked like new.
