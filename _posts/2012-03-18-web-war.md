This is a simple demo that builds a video game level based on the content of a webpage.  

[<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-46" title="webwar" src="{{ site.image_host }}/2012/03/webwar-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />]({{ site.image_host }}/2012/03/webwar.jpg)  

I&#8217;ve always been interested in proceduraly generated level design, and one of these days I might actually make a game that uses actual web layouts as the source of the game levels.

  
Specify a page (ie. google.com) and hit go.  
Once a the stage is generated you can navigate around it with the mouse. z and Ctrl+z zoom in and out.  
clicking on a tile shows the text it contains.

This takes the form a a java applet that used to be included here, but those are pretty much unviewable these days.  
<applet archive="../../WebWar.jar" code="webwar.Main.class" name="WebWar" width="800" height="650"></applet>
