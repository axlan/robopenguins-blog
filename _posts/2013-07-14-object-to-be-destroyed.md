I decided to recreate a sculpture I saw while in Spain for my Optometrist to be brother. A very simple project, but I had fun making the lenticular eye.

Here&#8217;s a video of the original taken at the Reina Sofia, the same place I saw it.  


The history of the piece is a little odd and is detailed on wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object\_to\_Be_Destroyed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_to_Be_Destroyed)Â . Seemed appropriate to make a duplicate myself.

Getting a nice wood metronome off ebay was pretty cheap and easy. I generate the simple lenticular eye using a the tool linked to here <http://makezine.com/2009/01/15/lenticular-image-tool/> The site is in German, but it was easy enough to figure out.

**Update from the future:**  
I went with my brother to Madrid and got a picture of him next to the original!
