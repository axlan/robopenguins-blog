For mother's day, I edited together a web comic to celebrate Maria's efforts to teach our daughter to read.

Maria is a long time Duolingo power user. She recently started doing some reading exercises with our daughter. When she found out that Duolingo had an app to teach reading, she was excited to give it a try. Unfortunately, it didn't seem very effective (like Duolingo proper) so she gave up on it.

I had a sense I wanted to make a Duolingo themed mother's day give, and ended up with this:

[See it here. (sound when scrolled to the end, though browsers are a bit inconsistent about playing it unless you click in the page to give it focus)](https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/object/maria-gift?region=us-west-1&bucketType=general&prefix=mother_day_2025/index.html)

This is mostly a light Photoshop (GIMP actually) of the Duolingo promotional comic: <https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/duolingo/list?title_no=6858>

In trying to turn my family into Duolingo characters, I stumbled upon this design guide which was interesting: <https://design.duolingo.com/illustration/shape-language>. Eventually, I took the easy way out and just used AI.

Since I was using the free options, I found ChatGPT did a bit better then the others I tried. Still, it was easier to use GIMP to fix up the mistakes (like adding cats to Maria):

I also had luck using the less effective AI to do some minor edits to save tokens:

Going from happy:

To sad:
